##Blog Teasers

Presents a site visitor with a brief overview of a blog article they can interact with to read the full article.

###When to Use

Use when a blog article relates to the overall content presented on a rackspace.com page. When this blog article furthers the conversation of the information conveyed on the page.

###How to use

Find compelling content on the Rackspace Blog and include the post title and a teaser portion of the body copy. Add the blog teaser element on pages that enhance the effectiveness of the blog post content. Embedding blog content that relates to a specific product page assists in showing our brand as being technology experts. If using the RSS feed an image of Racker whom wrote the post will be included.

###User Story

Mark is browsing rackspace.com to acquire information regarding the product offering. From the product page he is presented with a blog teaser that highlights recent developments on the Rackspace Cloud platform. Finding the content interesting he clicks the 'Read More' hyperlink. He enjoys the blog article and the perspective Rackspace employee Joseph provides him. Marks signs up for the Rackspace blog via RSS feed and browses previous articles written by Joseph.

###Design Rationale

Rackspace is a company of technology specialists who openly share their expertise to the world. Our blog is well versed in a variety of categories and topics related to our product and service offerings and making them easily available to our site visitors increases our opportunities to become more known for our thought leadership and friendly expertise. Including an image of the Racker allows site visitors to connect to our specialists and easily follow their favorites. Not having images makes it more difficult for site visitors to make a solid connection with the writer. This approach is similar to how newspapers present their editorial content.

##Carousels

Site visitors need to browse through a collection of information.

###When to Use

Use when displaying sets of information unique to a category. Screen space is limited and the designer is unable to display all visual assets on screen at one time.

###How to use

Provide a visual scroll interaction to inform the site viewer the content is a carousel and can be interacted with to view additional assets in the collection. Plan the order of the assets. Begin with the most common or relevent assets and work outwards. Engaging a content strategist to assist in order can prove beneficial.

###Design Rationale

Carousels provide an interactive means for a site visitor to engage with content and allows the designer to maximize the screen view. By way of progressive disclosure, information is hidden behind an interaction which can focus the site visitor on a smaller set of information and allow them to engage to seek more.
