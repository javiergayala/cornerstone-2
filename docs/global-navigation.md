##Global Navigation

The site visitor needs to quickly and easily path to a given section of a web site. We use the global navigation in conjunction with the hero banner as a general way finding device to assist in our site visitors pathing throughout the site.

###When to Use

Apply the global navigation element to all pages within a given website. If you're working on a marketing landing page (e.g., for a pay-per-click (PPC) campaign, display ad campaign, etc.) that is not incorporated into the global website,  please do not use this element.

###How to use

Global navigation is the second element on the website and is placed directly below the eyebrow. On desktop, a way finding carrot appears to help the site visitor understand where they are within the site.

###Design Rationale

Consistent global navigation allows customers to safely explore our product offerings. By presenting a consistent navigation element at the top of the screen a customer is able to delve deeper into the task they want to accomplish. As they move through various product screens they are provided a visual anchor. This is especially important when dealing with the technical information displayed on our screen as it gives them a way to navigate back to a friendly page if they find themselves in uncharted territories
