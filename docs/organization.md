##Carousels

Site viewer needs to browse through a collection of Visual assets.

###When to Use

Use when displaying visual assets that apply a unique category. Screen space is limited and the designer is unable to display all visual assets on screen at one time.

###How to use

Provide a visual scroll interaction to inform the site viewer the content is a carousel and can be interacted with to view additional assets in the collection. Plan the order of the assets. Begin with the most engaging or relevent assets and work outwards. Engaging a content strategist to assist in order can prove beneficial.

###Design Rationale

Carousels provide an interactive means for a customer to engage content. The carousel allows a designer to maximize the screen view. By hiding information behind an interaction the site visitor is enabled to focus on a limited set of visual asset at a given time.
